	 <p>	Looking back, the most fascinating point in my early childhood was related to my name, including how I got it and what it was intended to mean. My given name in Chinese is "Ke'er", which refers to "lovely child" literally. Actually, its meaning is more than that. The name "Ke'er" is so attractive and amazing that even my Chinese teacher in high school said, "How wonderful your name is!"    
	It was said that my family spent a large sum of time seeking for good characters in the dictionary that could stand for greatness and ambition, but no one was capable of finding out an adequate solution. Therefore, they turned to Aunt Qiu for help, who was my mother's best friend. She proposed, "Why not call her 'Ke'er'? It sounds simple, but it stands for purity. Purity is enough." So I received my name, and I grew up from then on in the name of purity.
